For our Present study, we have trained the MPINN 10 times for each system properties (eg. total energy per atom, pressure, diffusion coefficient)

The variable 'error' contains the median error of all 10 training result.

The naming of the workspace is done this way: 

workspace_NAME OF THE PROPERTY_PERCENTAGE OF HF DATA.mat

All the workspaces in this folder belong to two component system
