MATLAB scripts and workspaces of the MPINN, along with training data for both benchmark and nanofluid viscosity study are available in this repository.
Also, the computational costs associated with all the individual benchmark MD simulations are available in this repository.

Each folder has its own read_me.txt file. Read them before manipulating any files.

It is better to have prior knowledge of the paper where data is used to understand the functions of different files.

User of the data files may find the codes complicated. Please contact the author through: mahmudulridzy@gmail.com
