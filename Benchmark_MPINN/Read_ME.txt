Run combine.m file in MATLAB to get all the workspaces used in the postprocessing of the present study

The data files in this folder are for total system energy. If you want to train with other properties, copy the data files from 'One_component_training_data' and 'Two_component_training_data' folder.
Change the lines 14 and 18 of combine.m to appropriate file name (eg. 'D_high_fidelity_%d.txt' and 'D_high_fidelity.txt' for self diffusion coefficient)
